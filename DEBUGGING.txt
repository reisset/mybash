DEBUGGING - RESOLVED ISSUES

## Fixed Issues

### Bug 1: nerdfetch download failure (404 error) - FIXED
**Root Cause:** Incorrect GitHub repository URL
- **Old URL:** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TadeasKriz/nerdfetch/master/nerdfetch`
- **New URL:** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThatOneCalculator/NerdFetch/main/nerdfetch`
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - nerdfetch now downloads successfully

### Bug 2: "local: can only be used in a function" error - FIXED
**Root Cause:** `local` keyword used outside function context at line 197
- **Location:** Kitty default terminal setup section
- **Fix:** Removed `local` keyword from `kitty_path="$(command -v kitty)"`
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Script now passes syntax validation

### NPM PATH Issue - INVESTIGATED
**Analysis:** The mentioned PATH modification (`export PATH="$(npm config get prefix)/bin:$PATH"`) was not found in the current codebase.
- **Current Implementation:** The script safely adds `~/.local/bin` to PATH without overwriting existing PATH
- **Location:** `scripts/bashrc_custom.sh` lines 10-12
- **Status:** ✅ NO ISSUE FOUND - Current implementation is safe

## Verification

### nerdfetch Fix Verification:

```

### Syntax Error Fix Verification:
```bash
$ bash -n install.sh
# No errors (previously failed at line 197)
```

### PATH Safety Verification:
```bash
# Current safe implementation in bashrc_custom.sh
if [[ ":$PATH:" != *":$HOME/.local/bin:"* ]]; then
    export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"  # Appends, doesn't overwrite
fi
```
